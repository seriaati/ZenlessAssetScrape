# IMPORTANT!
hakush.in released their [ZZZ companion](https://zzz.hakush.in/) and you should use their [API](https://api.hakush.in/zzz/data/en/character/1061.json) instead, if your project uses Python, you can use my [API wrapper](https://github.com/seriaati/hakushin-py).  
I won't be archiving this repo just yet, in case someone still relies on it.
